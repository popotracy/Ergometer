# Ergometer


MATLAB-based user interfaces for applying the ergometer to the experimental paradigms. The interface will be used to provide 1) visual feedback, 2) data acquisition via National Instrument 9205, and 3) sending and receiving the triggers for the purpose of synchronizing signal recording (EEG, EMG, voltage...etc.).


## Fatigue 

Purpose of the experiment...
The ratio(percentage) of applied force to  MVC will be presented in the format of a real-time bar. The height of the bar represents the percentage. The experimental task is finished until the participant feels fatigued.

## EEG 

Purpose of the experiment...
The ratio(percentage) of applied force to  MVC will be presented in the format of a rolling ball in a tunnel. The participant is requested to apply his/her force to ramp the ball up and maintain it at a certain threshold for 1mins. During the experiment, the brain signal of the participant will be recorded by EEG.
